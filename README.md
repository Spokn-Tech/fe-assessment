# Frontend Assessment

In this task, weâ€™re evaluating your coding style, state management and component structure. 
In this app we want you to build an audio player by the help of the firebase stourage, user should be able to:
- Create an audio.
- Delete audio
- list audios and play them.
The created audio object should be something like this:
```
{
id:...,
name: ...,
description: ...,
thumbnail: ...,
audio_src: ...
}
```

The player functionalities:
- Play/Pause.
- Go to next and previous track.
- Playback speed.
- Volume controls
- Progress bar (user can go to any point in the audio using the progress bar) .
- Auto play the next audios in the playlist.

## Software stack:
- ReactJs
- Firebase
 
Feel free to use any additional third-party components libraries for styling.

## Bonus Points:
- Reorder the audios in the palylist.
- Shuffle play.
